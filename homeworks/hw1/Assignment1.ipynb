    "In the sensor module scheduled later on in the semester, we will be instrumenting a model bridge and testing it to failure. A photo and schematic diagram of the model bridge is shown in Fig. 1. The model consists of two identical 2D frames placed in parallel and connected by diagonal and horizonal braces (Pink lines). A vertical load will be applied at the top two nodes using a load spreader frame (light Blue). In the experiment, the model bridge will be placed between two rigid supports as shown in Fig. 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bridge is made of stainless steel angle bars and sheets as shown in Fig. 3. The angle bar has a dimension of ½ inch x ½ inch x 3/80 inch (thickness). Two angle bars are used for the top four frame members (Yellow lines in Fig. 1 or L2&L3 in Fig. 2), whereas one angle bar is used for the other members (Red, Blue and Pink lines in Fig. 1 or L4&L5 in Fig. 2). The Young’s modulus and yield strength of the angle bar are 190 GPa and 350 MPa, respectively. The members are connected by rivets. \n",

Try different spring stiffness values (softer one represents more imperfection)."
