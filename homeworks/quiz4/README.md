# Quiz 4

In this quiz, you will be asked to visualize the results of the all-or-nothing traffic assignment that you have generated in Quiz 3. You will be provided with:
* road network geometry file [berkeley_edges.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCB-CE170a/Fall2020/master/traffic_data/berkeley_edges.csv)

In addition, you will need:
* quiz3_[your_name].csv: link volume outputs from quiz 3
* QGIS

The outcome you will need to obtain and submit is:
* a map showing the traffic volume on each road link. Add the following elements: scale, north arrow, legend, title, and background map.

We have prepared the python code for you to add the road geometry column to your traffic volume data. Simply open the notebook, upload your `quiz3_[your_name].csv` when required, download the output files and visualize them in QGIS.
