# Traffic Inputs Demonstrations


## Objectives
* Retrieving road network from OpenStreetMap (OSM) with interatively or via command line.
* Retrieving cleaned road network using [OSMnx](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/).
* Construct a graph object using [sp](http://github.com/cb-cities/sp.git).
* Construct a travel demand file for an evacuation setting as origin-destination lists based on given evacuation zones.
* Retrieving the shortest path on a road network graph between given origin and destination using the [sp](http://github.com/cb-cities/sp.git).
* Note: this exercise does not cover how to write a code implementing the Dijkstra's Algorithm.
