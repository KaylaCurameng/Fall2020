    "# Introduction\n",
    "Infrastructures nowadays are generating data at such a rapid rate and great volume that it is sometimes impossible to handle them in traditional ways. Fortunately, programming tools such Python include many powerful libraries that can assist the data wrangling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn to read and analyze tabular and tree-structured data. Both of which are among the most popular types of inputs you will get for your work or research. Specifically, we will show how to handle `.csv`-like files using the Pandas library (https://pandas.pydata.org/) and perform tasks such as imputing missing data, looping through each row and merging two tables. The Pandas library also works well with other tabular data sources, such as the popular `.xlsx` file. On the other hand, Python can also work with semi-structured tree-like data (e.g., `.json` or `.xml`) using standard libraries (https://docs.python.org/3/library/). Pandas is not a Python standard library, thus it usually requires installation. The `json` and `xml` libaries are included in the Python standard libraries and do not require additional installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though tools such as Pandas is handy and efficient, it should be noted that data processing (cleaning, merging, validation, etc.), or sometimes even making sense of the data, can still take the majority of the time in an infrastructure analysis project."

    "You are probably familiar with tabular data by using tools such as MS Excel or Google Spreadsheets. If we view each row as a separate record (e.g., the three rows in the table below represent three separate roads), then all records share the same set of attributes, (e.g., all roads have five attributes: ID, name, direction, start_intersection, end_intersection). Because of this highly structured format, there is no need to store the name of attributes for each record, which saves a lot of space for large data files compared to `.json` or `.xml` file that will be introduced later.\n",

In this case, you will need to select the data based on some criteria (e.g, give me the `n`-th row or give me all records whose `name` is `Hearst_Ave`). Index in Pandas (as well as in Python) is 0-based, meaning the row id of the first record is 0, the row id of the second record is 1, and so forth. Selecting data in pandas is usually performed by `df.loc[]` (label based) or `df.iloc[]` (integer position based). Or use `df[column_name]` is also handy to retrieve a certain column in the dataframe. We will explain how to use them in the exercise below.\n",

However, for beginners, it is easier to just think of this task as looping through each row of the dataframe (using `iterrows()` or `itertuples()`) and performing the same operations on each row. The performance is usually not worse than more sophisticated methods (unless you are doing simple algebra calculations, which can be vectorized and run much faster with NumPy, see https://engineering.upside.com/a-beginners-guide-to-optimizing-pandas-code-for-speed-c09ef2c6a4d6).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce the `itertuples()` method here. It is typically used with a `for` loop. Inside the `for` loop, you can get the value under a specific column of the current row with `getattr()` method."
