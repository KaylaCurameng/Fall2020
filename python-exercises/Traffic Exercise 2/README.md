# Traffic Exercise 2

Shortest path calculation is a fundamental step in the traffic simulation in this module. In this exercise, we will learn to use the [sp](http://github.com/cb-cities/sp.git) code to compute the shortest path.

## Objectives
* Construct a graph object using [sp](http://github.com/cb-cities/sp.git).
* Retrieving the shortest path on a road network graph between given origin and destination.
* Note: this exercise does not cover how to write a code implementing the Dijkstra's Algorithm.
