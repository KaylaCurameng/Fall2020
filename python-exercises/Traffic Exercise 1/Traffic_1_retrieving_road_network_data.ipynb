        "Overpass-turbo and Overpass introduced above can be used to download raw data from the OSM. It is useful if you want to make customized road network from the scratch. However, this is often not the case as cleaning the raw data can be a time consuming process. For example, in traffic simulations, we need the road network as a directed graph, which the OSM raw data is close to, but not exactly so. If you want to get a cleaned graph, you can use the excellent [OSMnx package](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/). It was developed by [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/) while he was a PhD student at UC Berkeley. The [original blog post](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/) and [code repo](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) provide clear instructions of how to use it. Here we will show how to retrieve the road network of North Berkeley, the one we will use for the homework of this module."
